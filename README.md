# test-dpd

This is a test task for someone trying to get a job at some company. They are looking for someone who has 2+ years of experience(3+ on the website), apparently.

## a meme

- me, a dev with no job experience yet, looking for a job.
- see a company looking for a middle level dev
- "we have a test task"
- know that they will not look at my skills anyway if I don't have the ""experience"".
- contact them to get the task anyway
- "can we look at your resume"
- _gives them the resume link_
- "do you have a real job experience?"
- nah, but I would like to get the task regardless if it's possible.
- gives me the task
- let me see...
- _this_
- some time passes
- here is your code, do whatever you want with it<br/>
